# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors, maintainers, and users of **Psychic Canary** pledge to make participation in our project a fun, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of experience level, background, or how seriously you take your portfolio.

Psychic Canary is, at its core, a playful experiment: thermodynamic phase inference for market regimes? Come on, that's delightfully weird and fun. We want the community around it to feel the same way—curious, creative, a little irreverent, and always kind.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and fun environment include:

- Being respectful and inclusive toward others
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Sharing clever ideas, wild theories, and meme-worthy backtest results
- Celebrating wins (even paper ones) and laughing at drawdowns together
- Helping newcomers who are just here because "psychic canary" sounded cool

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Insulting or derogatory comments (about code, trades, or people)
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Unsolicited financial advice presented as fact
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or friendly setting

## Fun Is Encouraged

We explicitly welcome:

- Light-hearted banter and trading memes
- Creative names for market phases ("Superbubbly Plasma Regime" is valid)
- Sharing absurd ideas just to see if they work
- Enthusiasm, even (especially) if you're wrong

Just keep it kind. Humor at someone else's expense isn't funny.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the maintainer directly (GoodRoyal). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

If a participant violates this Code of Conduct, maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including removal from the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with modifications to keep the spirit of Psychic Canary alive.

Thank you for helping keep Psychic Canary a fun, weird, and welcoming place to explore markets! 🐤✨
